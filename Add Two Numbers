You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Code:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: ListNode
        :type l2: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        dummy_head = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy_head
        carry = 0

        while l1 is not None or l2 is not None:
            x = l1.val if l1 is not None else 0
            y = l2.val if l2 is not None else 0
            sum = carry + x + y
            carry = sum // 10
            current.next = ListNode(sum % 10)
            current = current.next
            if l1 is not None:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2 is not None:
                l2 = l2.next
        if carry > 0:
            current.next = ListNode(carry)
        return dummy_head.next
